Format for Interval File:

* each line is : chr leftpos rightpos. For example, chr1 100 102
* Intervals are assumed to contain the endpoints
* leftpos must be less then or equal to rightpos
* a sorted interval file means it is sorted first alphabetically by chr and then numerically by leftpos 



intIntersect

* This program takes as input:
 (1) stdin, a non-overlapping sorted interval file
 (2) first parameter -- a non-overlapping sorted interval file 
* The output is the set of intervals from 1 that intersect with at least one interval from 2 



intIntersect2

Same as intIntersect except the first parameter is just a single interval on the command line.



intJoin

* stdin: a sorted interval file
* output: a sorted intervals where overlapping intervals have been merged 



intRemove

This program takes as input:
1) stdin, an interval file
2) the first parameter: a non-overlapping sorted interval file.
The output is the set of intervals from 1 neither of whose endpoints are contained in an interval from 2.



intRemove2

Same as intIntersect except the first parameter is just a single interval on the command line.



intSub

This program takes as input:

1) stdin, a non-overlapping sorted interval file, with an optional fourth column containing labels for each interval.

2) first parameter -- a non-overlapping sorted interval file.

The output is the set of intervals from 1 that do not intersect with anything from 2.

The intervals that do overlap are chopped up so as to remove the intervals from 2.

The labels are maintained during chopping
